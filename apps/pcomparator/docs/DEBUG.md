`screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()`

The **`screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()`** function is a method provided by Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. It is used to display the Testing Playground URL in the console output when running tests.

### Usage

When running tests using Jest, it can be helpful to display the Testing Playground URL. This can be convenient for debugging tests or accessing the Testing Playground directly to explore the state of components during the test.

To use **`screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()`**, you first need to have Jest configured and run your tests. In a test file, you can call this function to display the Testing Playground URL in the console output.

Here's an example of usage:

```tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

test('my test', () => {
  render(<MyComponent />);
  // Perform test actions on your component

  // Display the Testing Playground URL in the console
  screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL();
});
```

When this test is executed, the console output will display the Testing Playground URL. You can click on this URL to open the Testing Playground in your browser.
